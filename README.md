What is this?
-------------

This is a simple Search Engine written in Python/Qt
which indexes the daily stories of AP newswires of the year 1989.

How can we try?
---------------

You have to checkout the full repository from
https://github.com/piyush1405/-Semantic-Search-Engine-for-Q-A-Design-Code

and then run the application with the following command:

python build.py -x

Once the application is launched, you first have to create
the indexes and then load them before being able to query the
document base.

NOTE: This is not tested at all on Windows.
